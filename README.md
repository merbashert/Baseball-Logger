# Baseball-Logger

### My husband mentioned that he needed something to keep track of which pitches he was throwing in his baseball video game, and a random pitch generator for when he was having trouble deciding what to throw.  I used Javascript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery to try and solve his problem!

My first complete non-class project!
